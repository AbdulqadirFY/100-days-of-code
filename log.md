### Day 1: July 15, 2020

Today is a big day! Excited to be taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
My goal is to befriend:

I will do my best to see how far I can go in 3 months

**Today's Progress**: 
* Refreshing on Java fundamentals
* Solved problems on JetBrains academy's Java track.  

**Thoughts:** I have been going through Java fundamentals on and off for about three times now, I believe this will be the last. Time to level up! :muscle:

### Day 2: July 16, 2020
#### Worked 4.24 hours
**Today's Progress**: 
* I studied [Sass documentaion](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) and Completed Sass Challenges @freeCodeCamp. I covered: 
  * Sass variables, maps, mixins, loops, functions, Sass extend, Nesting CSS with Sass etc

**Thoughts:** I found Sass to be really interesting and efficient for writing style sheets.
